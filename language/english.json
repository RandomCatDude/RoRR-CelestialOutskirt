Pink gemstones dot the rock I'm standing on. Asteroids encircle the planet. The stars are innumerable; it reminds me of the view I had on the Contact Light. It's so beautiful, but I can't spend time admiring it. I have to find a way off, my oxygen supply won't last long in this thin atmosphere. I wonder how these creatures survive up here? Do they have help that I don't? But there's no time to waste. I must find a way back down to the planet.",
